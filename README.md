# 0x1D Binary Trees

## Overview

The goal of this project is to understand and test the use of the binary tree data structure in the C programming language. Some of the key points to be learned include:
 - What is a binary tree
 - What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
 - What is the possible gain in terms of the time complexity compared to linked lists
 - What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
 - What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
 - What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree.
